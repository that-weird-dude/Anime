    <h1>About Anime (アニメ)</h1>
    <h2>What is Anime?</h2>
    <br />
      <p class="about">
        Anime (アニメ) is a Japanese term for hand-drawn or computer animation.
        The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese,
        where this term references all animation. Outside Japan, anime is used
        to refer specifically to animation from Japan or as a
        Japanese-disseminated animation style.

    <p class="about">
      Anime consists of an ideal story-telling mechanism, combining graphic art,
      characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
      individualistic techniques. The production of anime focuses less on the
      animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the
      use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being
      hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction
      that provides an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse
      themselves into with relative ease.

    <h2>History and Development</h2>

      The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century,
      with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917. <br />
      <br />
      The first generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten
      Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi and Seitaro Kitayama, commonly referred to as
      the "fathers" of anime. Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi
      (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first
      anime feature film, were made during World War II. During the 1970s, anime
      developed further, separating itself from its Western roots, and
      developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre.
      Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy, Lupin III and Mazinger
      Z. During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially Hayao
      Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii. <br />

      In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in
      production with the rise in popularity of anime like Gundam, Macross,
      Dragon Ball, and genres such as real robot, space opera and cyberpunk.
      Space Battleship Yamato and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross also
      achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as Star
      Blazers and Robotech. <br />

      The film Akira set records in 1988 for the production costs of an anime
      film and went on to become an international success. Later, in 2004, the
      same creators produced Steamboy, which took over as the most expensive
      anime film. Spirited Away shared the first prize at the 2002 Berlin Film
      Festival and won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while
      Innocence: Ghost in the Shell was featured at the 2004 Cannes Film
      Festival.
