        Jokes. We get it. We all like to laugh. Science has proven again and
        again that laughter truly is the best medicine. Laughing for a bit each
        day has been proven to make us enjoy life better, lower blood pressure,
        release endorphins throughout our bodies (take that exercise!), and
        according to a study done in Norway, it might even help us live longer.
        So why not explore it through our favorite medium on this site, anime?

        Comedy isâ€¦ something that is at a bit of a crossroads in Japan. While
        it's okay for men to laugh, sometimes women can still be frowned upon
        for laughing in public. At home is one thing, but in front of others is
        another. Anime however, is one of those safe zones since people aren't
        usually watching it in public-except the guy we saw watching it on the
        train in Akihabara the other day-but at home. So welcome, if you are new
        to anime, this will help you see some anime that are easy to get into if
        you are new to comedy anime or just comedy. If you are a pro, then you
        might already know the ropes.

            Junior high school student, Shoyo Hinata, becomes obsessed with
            volleyball after catching a glimpse of Karasuno High School playing
            in Nationals on TV. Of short stature himself, Hinata is inspired by
            a player the commentators nickname 'The Little Giant', Karasuno's
            short but talented wing spiker. Though inexperienced, Hinata is
            athletic and has an impressive vertical jump. He joins his school's
            volleyball club - only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to
            spend the next two years trying to convince other students to help
            him practice. <br />
            <br />
            In the third and final year of junior high, some of Hinata's friends
            agree to join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his
            first official game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team
            favored to win the tournament - that included third-year Tobio
            Kageyama, a prodigy setter nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for
            both his skill and his brutal play style. The two spark a short
            rivalry, and after the game, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama in high
            school.

            The space opera follows the misadventures of Dandy, an alien bounty
            hunter who is "a dandy guy in space", in search for undiscovered and
            rare aliens with his robot assistant QT and his feline friend named
            Meow. Though he and his crew act with the best intentions, despite
            being normally dimwitted and next to useless, Dandy is unaware that
            he is being pursued by Dr. Gel of the Gogol Empire. <br />

            The series has loose continuity, with several episodes featuring the
            main protagonists and antagonists dying, getting turned into
            zombies, or getting trapped in different dimensions for periods of
            time, only for them to show up as normal in the next episode. There
            are also many references to older science fiction, music, anime and
            Internet culture.

            in an orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is
            born with the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power,
            Asta, with no magic instead focuses on physical strength.

            and the talent to control wind magic. <br />
            <br />

            of the Devil race who utilizes rare anti-magic. Afterward, he and
            Yuno each join a Magic Knight squad as the first step to fulfill
            their ambitions.
